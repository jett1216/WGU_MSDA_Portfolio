    "*\tCreating a model based on neural networks and VADER that can accurately conduct sentiment analysis on texts such as social media tweets can help gauge overall public opinion on company stocks. Those with positive sentiments may be worth investing in at that moment, while those carrying more negative public sentiments should be treated more cautiously when investing.\n",
    "*\tCombining Lexicon-based methods such as VADER with neural networks such as CNN-LSTMs is advantageous due to its hybrid nature. Lexicon-based methods rely on predefined dictionaries and provide a foundation for understanding sentiment, particularly for domain-specific language or less-trained deep-learning models. VADER is particularly suited to social media texts such as Tweets (Adam, 2023).\n",
    "*\tConversely, CNN-LSTM models excel at capturing contextual information and dependencies in text sequences. These types of networks can capture the nuances of language, including irony, sarcasm, and context-dependent meanings, which lexicons may struggle to process.\n",
    "*\tFor example, a customer review could say, \"The product is great, but the customer service was horrible.\" VADER might identify \"great\" as positive and \"horrible\" as negative. An LSTM network, however, can understand the context and relationship between these words, potentially recognizing that the overall sentiment of the review is negative due to the customer service experience. \n",
    "*\tFurther study and application of a model based on this type of sentiment analysis can be combined with forecasting methods such as time series analysis or even basic linear regression to determine whether a correlation of some sort exists between the current public opinion of a company/stock and whether the closing price of that stock increased or decreased relative to its opening price, however, for this capstone project, only the sentiment analysis portion will be conducted.\n"

Bidirectional LSTM layers were employed since they account for past and future data points for every step.\n",

    "*\tThe dataset used to create this model was initially composed of 80,793 rows of tweets regarding several publicly traded companies and their stock. After initial positive/negative sentiment labeling with VADER's Sentiment Intensity Analyzer, the model was trained on 80% of the overall dataset and tested on the remaining 20% (half of this was used for validation). The constructed model could predict sentiment with an accuracy of about 98.6% on the train set, about 88.7% on the validation set, and about 88.7% again on the test set. Test loss was about 35.8%. The overall neural network architecture and the chosen set of hyperparameters contributed to these scores. Further optimization may increase the accuracy. However, the accuracy of all three split components of the data is already relatively high. Therefore, an even larger dataset to train on may yield more gains in comparison to hyperparameter optimization."

    "*\tIn the context of the original research question and the initial model built to answer it, using neural networks and VADER, we can successfully create a model that can accurately predict the sentiment behind a tweet or review with at least 70% accuracy. Therefore, we can reject the null and accept the alternative hypothesis since our accuracies between the train, test, and validation sets all score significantly above 70% accuracy."

    "#### E2: Limitation of Chosen Analysis\n",
    "* \tOne major limitation of the chosen analysis stems from the initial sentiment labeling performed by VADER's Sentiment Intensity Analyzer. This step was unavoidable and necessary since the tweets in the raw data set had no prior sentiment labeling applied to them. VADER was one of the best choices for this task since its strength lies in handling social media texts and their associated nuances. In a worst-case scenario, improper/inaccurate labeling of VADER could lead to bigger trickle-down effects as the data is fed into more complicated models, such as the neural networks we employed. However, this inherent weakness was also the reason for selecting a combination of convoluted and recurrent neural network features. Hybrid solutions between VADER and these neural network architectures were chosen to use the strength of one to cover the inherent weakness of another in a complementary fashion. "

    "#### E3: Recommended Course of Action Based on Results\n",
    "* \tAccording to the results of the analyses, the hybrid approach using lexicon-based tools such as VADER in combination with neural networks is quite capable of creating a model with high accuracy for sentiment analysis. We will treat this as proof-of-concept verification and recommend exploring other similar lexicon-neural network solutions. One neural network architecture we may be interested in attempting this approach with is Transformers. One intriguing key feature of this specific architecture is that it can parallel processes and uses an attention mechanism that focuses on different parts of the input sequence when making predictions. For example, this allows it to learn relationships between words that might be far apart in a sentence."

    "*\tAs mentioned in the introduction, further study and application of a model based on this type of sentiment analysis can be combined with forecasting methods. One example would be time series analysis. It would also be interesting to see the results of combining the results of a sentiment analysis such as this one with basic linear regression. Regardless of the method used, it would prove insightful to determine whether a correlation exists between the current public opinion of a company/stock and whether that stock's closing price increased or decreased relative to its opening price.\n",
    "*\tAnother implementation building upon the model we created could come in the form of a churn analysis and its relationship with the public perception of a company based on the sentiment analysis results.\n",
    "*\tWhether the further implementation of a sentiment analysis model such as the one we created is used for finance/company stock applications or used in conducting studies into the state of a company's PR, rate of churn, and many other applications, it proves itself as a handy tool in business and data analysis.\n"
